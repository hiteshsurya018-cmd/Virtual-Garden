## 🐍 Backend Setup (For Real AI Detection)

To get **real YOLOv5 plant detection**, set up the Python backend:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed on your local machine
- pip package manager
- About 2GB disk space for ML models

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd ml-backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup (downloads YOLOv5 model)
python setup.py

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Verify Backend
- Health check: http://localhost:8000/health
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "model_loaded": true}`

## 🔬 Testing Real vs Fallback Detection

### Current System (Fallback)
- ✅ Upload works immediately
- ✅ Shows realistic plant information
- ✅ Demonstrates all UI features
- ⚠️ Detection results are simulated

### With Backend Running
- 🚀 **Real YOLOv5 AI detection**
- 📊 **Accurate bounding boxes**
- 🔬 **Scientific plant identification**
- 💯 **True confidence scores**
- 🌿 **Precise medicinal properties**

## 📱 Current System Capabilities

### Plant Database (25+ Species)
- **Herbs**: Basil, Mint, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Oregano
- **Medicinal**: Aloe Vera, Echinacea, Turmeric, Ginger
- **Flowers**: Lavender, Chamomile, Rose, Hibiscus
- **Trees**: Eucalyptus, Tea Tree
- **And many more...**

### Plant Information Includes
- 🧬 **Scientific names**
- 💊 **Medicinal properties**
- 🌱 **Growing conditions**
- ⚠️ **Usage warnings**
- ⭐ **Difficulty ratings**
- 📅 **Harvest times**

### Advanced Features
- 🎨 **Bounding box visualization**
- 🎯 **Confidence filtering**
- 🔍 **Plant search & categorization**
- 🌍 **3D garden templates**
- 💾 **Save/load garden layouts**
- 📤 **Export functionality**

## 🎮 Try These Features Now

1. **Upload Multiple Images**
   - Test batch upload functionality
   - See how different images are processed

2. **Explore Plant Categories**
   - Filter by "Immunity", "Skincare", "Digestive"
   - See specialized medicinal plants

3. **Design Your Garden**
